//  2. Why process.exit(1) in catch block?


// process.exit(1);
// This immediately stops the server if the database connection fails.

// 1 means “exit with failure.”

// 0 would mean “exit successfully.”

//  Why do this?
// Because if your app fails to connect to MongoDB, it should NOT keep running.
// You don’t want routes trying to query a DB that’s not even connected — it leads to confusing bugs.

// So we fail fast, clearly and loudly.
